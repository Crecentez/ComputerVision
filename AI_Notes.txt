Agents AI


nural networks
pythorch

what are matricies
feed table into pytorch
tell pytroch the ouput of nural network should be as close to temp
take the predicted and actual to compare with calc to update the model
AI = complex nural network that is trained to predict the next word in text fromt he internet.
What they did: Download internet > Feed Each word as a vector/series of numbers > "I went to the store to buy" Each word is a vector of numbes > Feed to predict something like "Milk" > Learned from alll fo the internet.
AI is just a powerful google search
AI will take the word with the highest probability -> Tempature zero
something with one of the highest.
Tempature -> 0 mean the highest probability word. Changing this variable can change the p

Agents are a sub program to find and send data to the Model
